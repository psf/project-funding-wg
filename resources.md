# Resources

Per the [charter](https://wiki.python.org/psf/ProjectFundingWG) of the Project Funding Working Group, we offer the following resources for any organization or individual that wishes to secure funding to improve the Python ecosystem.

## Budgeting
Creating a budget is an essential requirement of most funding applications.

## Grant Writing
Writing a grant proposal can be a daunting task for first-time writers. Here is some collected wisdom.

## Example grant applications

We are working to collect submitted grants from the community, so that you can get a better idea of what is required.
This section will contain grant proposals for programs that we list in our [funders list](funders.md).
