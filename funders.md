“Epic Games has committed $100 million to support game developers, enterprise professionals, media and entertainment creators, students, educators, and tool developers doing amazing things with Unreal Engine or enhancing open-source capabilities for the 3D graphics community.”

“Tool & Open-Source Developers

Developing a software tool that integrates with UE4? Creating open-source tools or enhancing the capabilities of open-source software to benefit the 3D graphics community? We love supporting open projects that solve tough problems or improve workflows.”

“Tools and open-source development: You can submit an application for a new tool, plans to port existing tools to UE4, or creating tools that integrate existing software with UE4. You can also submit a new open-source tool (including tools that provide interoperability) or any enhancement for existing open-source projects related to 3D graphics. For new tools, we would like to see a detailed plan or, if available, a prototype.”

Heard about this via https://godotengine.org/article/godot-engine-was-awarded-epic-megagrant -- looks like we don’t have to be directly connected to Unreal Engine to apply.
