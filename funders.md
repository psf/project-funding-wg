## Mozilla/MOSS Foundational Tech track.
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/foundational-technology/

Deadline: monthly rolling -- **note**: [not open to new applications in 2020](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/), more info coming in 2021 about future award cycles.
https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS#Application_Deadlines -- takes several 
months to finalize & award, but you’ll generally get accepted or rejected within 6 weeks

Amount: "historically .... $5,000 and $150,000" but max $250,000

Connection: Champions: Dan Callahan, Jannis Leidel, etc. and our liaisons from previous grants, and people we know in this list https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Foundational_Technology/Projects_We_Use

Status: Through end of June 2020: finishing MOSS-funded project on pip work. Ok to submit multiple requests on different projects.


## Tweag Open Source Fellowship

https://boards.greenhouse.io/tweag/jobs/4638654002 -- also see blog posts https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-02-14-os-fellowship/ and https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-07-28-os-fellowship/

Eligibility:

> The Tweag Open Source Fellowship program invites you to contribute to the open-source community via a 12-week paid fellowship.

> A typical outcome would be a mix of a coordinated open source contribution, a new tool or prototype, a scientific research paper, or a conference presentation. As long as the project benefits the open-source community, interpreted broadly, it is a suitable project for a Fellowship; research-oriented or risky Fellowships are explicitly permitted.

> Fellows may contribute to any domain, provided we have the in-house expertise to suitably mentor the project.

> Projects must be aligned with our mission to advance the open source software ecosystem in a sustainable way: We believe that a community of users and developers is essential for the long term development of software. We therefore favour **reproducible, shareable and composable contributions**, and we favour contributions that **align with community interests and integrate in larger software ecosystems**.

Budget: "Fellows earn compensation according to the regionally adjusted scale posted by the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends)." So the stipend would be between $1500 USD and $3300 USD for twelve weeks of work.

Deadline: "Individual projects will be selected twice a year with deadlines on March 30 and September 30. Notifications will be within two weeks of these dates. The Fellowship itself must be started within 6 months of acceptance, at a time mutually agreeable to the applicant and the Tweag mentor." Currently open for applications to be reviewed in the next cycle (deadline March 30, 2021).

Status: We're not aware of any individuals working in Python who have applied for a Tweag Fellowship. You could be the first!


## Cisco

https://research.cisco.com/research

Eligibility: a wide range of open source software or research/development projects. For instance, see in section 3 where they are interested in "Predicting and mitigating security vulnerabilities in software components and systems" -- we could submit to the Integrity or to the general/catchall RfP.

Budget: very open. Sumana emailed them to ask about budget range, and the response was:

> We do not provide a budget range as budgets depend on the institution and geography, since costs vary. Research funds should cover costs associated with the following for one year of research funding:
> * Graduate or post graduate students employment
> * Limited release time (1-2 months) for PI
> * Research support costs (e.g., equipment, laptops, incidental costs)
> * Travel associated with research (e.g., conferences, standards)
> * Overhead for research gifts is limited to 5%

This implies that they are more focused on academia, but their webpage says "Open Source Projects, Industry Consortia, Standards Bodies, and Working Groups" are eligible, and Sumana didn't mention any academic institution in her email, so PSF is probably eligible.

Deadline: possibly none?


## NLNet

https://nlnet.nl/foundation/can_do.html

Eligibility: networking and internet technology, and/or especially privacy and trust enhancing technologies or search and discovery projects. "We put any money we can get our hands on where our mouth is: that is to increase the use of open technologies for society. What is important for us is that the technology you develop or help promote is usable for others and has the potential for real impact."

Particularly interested in research-heavy projects that will advance the state of the art; proposals should emphasize innovative engineering instead of just leaning on how big an impact the project would have on a big userbase.

https://nlnet.nl/propose/

Deadline: frequently rolling; next is December 1 2020; notification within a few months

Amount: up to 50,000 euros (about $57,000 USD)

Status: PSF has been rejected in the past, is welcome to reapply


## OpenHumans

Python connection: their funding supported [Kandra Labs](https://zulipchat.com/history/), the makers of [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/).

## Ruby Together
[Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/projects)

Open source projects that "benefit the Ruby community" are eligible. "We are happy to fund both boring work like triage and bugfixes as well as exciting work like creating new tools that have never existed before." There may be Python/Ruby interoperability stuff that is applicable here.

## Unreal Engine Epic MegaGrants
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants
Deadline: “The deadline for submission is directly dependent on the funds remaining in the program. At this point, there is no deadline.”

Amount: “Grants range from $5,000 to $500,000”

“Epic Games has committed $100 million to support game developers, enterprise professionals, media and entertainment creators, students, educators, and tool developers doing amazing things with Unreal Engine or enhancing open-source capabilities for the 3D graphics community.”

Eligibility: “Tool & Open-Source Developers

Developing a software tool that integrates with UE4? Creating open-source tools or enhancing the capabilities of open-source software to benefit the 3D graphics community? We love supporting open projects that solve tough problems or improve workflows.”

“Tools and open-source development: You can submit an application for a new tool, plans to port existing tools to UE4, or creating tools that integrate existing software with UE4. You can also submit a new open-source tool (including tools that provide interoperability) or any enhancement for existing open-source projects related to 3D graphics. For new tools, we would like to see a detailed plan or, if available, a prototype.”

Heard about this via https://godotengine.org/article/godot-engine-was-awarded-epic-megagrant -- looks like we don’t have to be directly connected to Unreal Engine to apply.
